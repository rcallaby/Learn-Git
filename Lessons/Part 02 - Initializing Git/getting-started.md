# Initialzing Git - Getting Started

## Basic Git Operations:
Git provides a vast array of commands for version control, but here are a few fundamental ones:

git init initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
git clone <repository_url> copies a remote repository to your local machine.
git add <file> stages changes made to a file for commit.
git commit -m "<commit_message>" commits the staged changes to the repository.
git push uploads your committed changes to a remote repository.
git pull fetches and merges changes from a remote repository to your local repository.
