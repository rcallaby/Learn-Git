# Learn-Git
This is where you will find a sample repository for my YouTube tutorial series on Learning Git and Github.
If you found this repository to be helpful, please consider giving it a star ‚≠ê as it will be easier for others to find it.

As well, it would greatly help me if you would subscribe to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@richardcallaby) as that is the place where I post free tutorials and other free educational resources.

## Here is a step by step tutorial on how to contribute to GitHub
Create a GitHub account: If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one. Go to github.com and click the "Sign up" button in the upper right corner. Follow the instructions to create your account.

Find a repository to contribute to: Once you have a GitHub account, you can search for repositories that you're interested in contributing to. You can use the GitHub search bar to search for repositories by name or keyword.

Fork the repository: Once you've found a repository that you want to contribute to, you'll need to fork it.

Forking creates a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account, which you can modify without affecting the original repository.

Click on the below button to fork the repository which lies on the upper right corner.

Clone the forked repository: After forking the repository, you'll need to clone it to your local machine. Cloning creates a copy of the repository on your computer that you can work on. To clone the repository, open a terminal window and enter the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
```
Be sure to replace "your-username" and "repository-name" with your GitHub username and the name of the repository you forked.

Make sure you create a uniquely named branch to reflect the changes you wish to make to the source code. To make a branch use the following syntax:

```
git branch "branch-name"
```

To switch on that branch use the following syntax :
```
git checkout "branch-name"
```

Make changes to the code: Once you have the repository cloned to your local machine, you can make changes to the code. Use your preferred text editor or IDE to modify the files.

Commit the changes: After making changes to the code, you'll need to commit them to your local repository. To do this, open a terminal window and navigate to the root of the cloned repository. Use the following command to stage the changes:

```
git add .
```

### Reference Image
![add](./images/Readme_images/add.png)

This will stage all changes made to the files in the repository.

Next, commit the changes using the following command:

```
git commit -m "A brief description of the changes made"
```

### Reference Image
![Commit](./images/Readme_images/commit.png)

Be sure to include a brief, informative message describing the changes you made.

Push the changes to GitHub: After committing the changes to your local repository, you'll need to push them to GitHub. This will update the copy of the repository in your GitHub account with the changes you made. To push the changes, use the following command:

```
git push origin branch-name
```

### Reference Image

Create a pull request: After pushing the changes to GitHub, when you reload the forked repository, you will see the option to create a pull request. Click on that button to create a pull request.

### Reference Image 
![Pull_Request](./images/Readme_images/pull%20request.png)


This will take you to a page where you can review the changes you made and provide a description of your pull request.

Make sure to include a clear and concise description of the changes you made and why you made them.

If there are any issues or concerns that the repository owner should be aware of, make sure to mention them in the pull request description.

Once you're satisfied with the description, click on the "Create pull request" button.

### Reference Image

Wait for feedback: After creating the pull request, the repository owner will review your changes and provide feedback.

They may ask you to make additional changes, or they may merge your changes into the original repository.

Be patient and responsive during this process, and make sure to address any feedback or concerns that the repository owner raises.

Update your forked repository: If the repository owner merges your changes into the original repository, you'll need to update your forked repository to reflect those changes.

To do this, navigate to your forked repository on GitHub and click on the "Fetch upstream" button.

Then, run the following command in your local repository to update it:

```
git pull
```

That should give you a brief idea of how to use Git, of course, you can look at the lessons that I have created in this repository for more in depth explanations.

## Good first issue

You can use this project as a way to start contributing to open source projects. This could be a **good first issue** just modify the [CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://github.com/rcallaby/Learn-Git/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md) file so that it links to your own GitHub repository. Use markdown as shown in the file. 

Please look at the [First-Contributions](https://github.com/rcallaby/Learn-Git/tree/main/First-Contributions) directory for a step by step directions on how to contribute to this repository.
