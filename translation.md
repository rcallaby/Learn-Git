# Translations

This repository contains translations of the Learn-Git documentation. IF you would like to contribute to translate this tutorial or in anyway make it easier for someone that speaks your language please follow these guidelines. While every effort is made to cater to as many languages and cultures as possible please understand that currently there is only one maintainer of this repository so no offense is intended if you don't see your native language listed.

## Contributing Translations
We welcome contributions to help translate our documentation into additional languages. To get started, please follow these steps:

+ First see if there is an open issue that caters to your language. If there is not create one so that the maintainer can keep track of the progress of translating the repository.
+ Fork this repository.
+ Create a new branch for your translation work.
+ Duplicate the contents in the directory in the root of the repository and rename it to the appropriate language code (e.g. fr for French).
+ Translate the contents of the files in the new directory.
+ Create a pull request with your changes.

### Please keep the following guidelines in mind when translating:

* Translate the text as faithfully as possible, while also considering the nuances of the target language.
* Use the appropriate terms and conventions for the target language.
* Keep the formatting and layout consistent with the original document.

#### Adding additional languages going forward
Due to certain difficulties with getting the lessons translated into different languages in a timely manner the only way to add your desired language to this repository it will need to be submitted in its complete state in a single pull request. While this may not be ideal it is the only way to ensure that this repository doesn't have open issues for months to years on end.

#### Future Hacktoberfest Events
This repository **will not** participate in any future Hacktoberfest events going forward. I want to thank each and every contributor who helped make this guide better by participating in open source both in and outside of Hacktoberfest. Those that participated in open source outside of an event like Hacktoberfest demonstrated their actual true interest in open source.

**We appreciate any contributions to help us make our documentation more accessible to a wider audience. Thank you for your help!**
